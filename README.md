# Coherence_Data_Extraction
Matlab code for the coherence data extraction of laser photos based on Fast Fourier Transform(FFT).
This piece of script is used to get the coherence time (or coherence length) of a pulse laser. Through FFT process, fringe visibility can be derived from the the interference pattern produced by overlapping the images from both arms of the interferometer.
